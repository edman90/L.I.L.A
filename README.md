# L.I.L.A

L.I.L.A is an artificial intelligence individual design project that I am embarking on for the pursuit of knowledge and for honoring a promise I made to a friend in May 2018.
My dog Lilly, was a 14 year old Beagle who joined dog heaven where all the dogs are jumping for joy everyday and all the dogs are dogecoin millionares. 
I was very emotionally affected by this event and at the time I desperately wanted to honor her memory in her absence and I could never think of how. It wasn't until some grieving later and watching Iron Man movies that I got the idea that I can honor her memory in an AI. I'd always wondered what she she sounded like under that beagle brain of hers so this could be my way of quenching that imaginitive thirt.

The project end goal is to have a sophisticated Artificial intelligence with several commands utilizing open source speech AI software.

As I become more familiar with AI development I will gradually tailor my contributions to this project to align with that goal.
For now, my first design will be a simple text-based AI in Java or Python as a proof of concept or a draft as you will. I will use online resources to support my goal. Important links that I come across will be posted below.
